        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        <h2>What's so special about The Obvious NDA?</h2>
        <p>Nothing.  It's bone-stock.  Orthodox.  Unsurprising.  Routine.  Banal.  <em>Boring</em>.</p>
        <p>The Obvious NDA differs from other NDAs only in how it protects you from having to reread it every time.  Every copy of The Obvious NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing it, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.  The license for the terms requires those who make changes to drop the name “The Obvious NDA” from their changed versions.</p>
        <h2>Will The Obvious NDA improve over time?</h2>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version of The Obvious NDA appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  When we find a way to improve 1.0.0, this site will publish a new version, perhaps version 1.0.1.  Version 1.0.0 will remain available.</p>
