        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        <h2>What’s so special about The Lost Serif NDA?</h2>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The Lost Serif NDA differs from other NDAs only in how it protects everyone from having to read it over and over again.  Every copy of The Lost Serif NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing it, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.  The license for the terms requires those who make changes to drop the name “The Lost Serif NDA” from their changed versions.</p>
        <h2>Will The Lost Serif NDA improve over time?</h2>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version of The Lost Serif NDA appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  When we find a way to improve 1.0.0, we’ll call it 1.0.1, or 2.0.0, or 55.44.321.  Anything but 1.0.0 again.  Version 1.0.0 always be the same.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <p>If you’s like an e-mail every time a new version comes out, <a href=mailto:kyle@lostserif.com?subject=Lost%20Serif%20NDA%20Updates%20List>e-mail kyle@lostserif.com</a> and ask to be added to the mailing list.</p>
        <h2>Did lawyers write and review this?</h2>
        <p>Yes.  But they are not your lawyers, or responsible to you for legal advice.</p>
