        The Obvious NDA is a boring mutual nondisclosure agreement for busy companies.
        If your company is tired of waiting for lawyers to read NDAs, or signing NDAs without reading them, try The Obvious NDA instead.

        <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
        <h2>What's so special about The Obvious NDA?</h2>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>The Obvious NDA differs from other NDAs only in how it protects everyone from having to read it over and over again.  Every copy of The Obvious NDA comes with a certificate from the side proposing it, guaranteeing that the terms are exactly the same as those published on this site.  The license for the terms requires those who make changes to drop the name “The Obvious NDA” from their changed versions.</p>
        <h2>Will The Obvious NDA improve over time?</h2>
        <p>Yes.  New versions will appear on this site.</p>
        <p>However, once a version of The Obvious NDA appears on this site, <em>that version will always read exactly the same</em>.  When we find a way to improve 1.0.0, we’ll call it 1.0.1, or 2.0.0, or 55.44.321.  Anything but 1.0.0 again.  Version 1.0.0 always be the same.  Old versions will remain available.</p>
        <h2>Did lawyers write and review this?</h2>
        <p>Yes.  But they are not your lawyers, or responsible to you for legal advice.</p>
        <p>You should have your lawyer review and approve the most recent version of The Obvious NDA, up at the top.  They can tell you whether and when The Obvious NDA is right for your company.</p>
        <p>If your lawyer has comments, feel free to have them <a href=mailto:comments@obviousnda.com>e-mail comments@obviousnda.com</a>.  We can and will incorporate feedback.</p>
